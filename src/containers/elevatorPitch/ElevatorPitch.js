				So, somewhere that’s easily accessible

				you should include a summary—no more than two to three 
				paragraphs long—laying out the most important things about 
				you. This could include major companies you’ve worked for, 
				projects you’ve worked on that you’re most proud of, your 
				“superpower” as a professional, and even a little personality. 
				Imagine people coming to your site and only reading this one 
				section. What would you want them to take away?
